Auto-Logout & Android (Warning)
With the Auto Logout approach implemented in the previous lecture, you'll very likely get a warning like this on Android

Setting a timer for a long period of time, i.e. multiple minutes, is a performance and correctness issue on Android as it keeps the timer module awake, and timers can only be called when the app is in the foreground. See httpsgithub.comfacebookreact-nativeissues12981

What's the problem

Using setTimeout() with a big timeout duration (as we're setting it = 1 hour), can't be handled in the most efficient way by Android. Unfortunately, there is no perfect solution available though but you can browse the referenced issue thread for possible workarounds httpsgithub.comfacebookreact-nativeissues12981
