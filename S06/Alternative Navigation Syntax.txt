Alternative Navigation Syntax
The navigate to new screen syntax shown in the previous lecture (and throughout this module) is pretty explicit clear, that's why I chose it for this introduction to React Navigation.

But instead of

props.navigation.navigate({routeName 'SomeIdentifier'});
you can also use

props.navigation.navigate('SomeIdentifier');
This alternative is of course a bit shorter, other than that, it has no advantage or disadvantages compared to the more explicit one.

Throughout the course, I'll use both alternatives.
