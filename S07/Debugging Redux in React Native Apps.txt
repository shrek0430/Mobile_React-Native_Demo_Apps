Debugging Redux in React Native Apps
You can debug Redux in React Native apps with help of the React Native Debugger tool httpsgithub.comjhen0409react-native-debuggerblobmasterdocsredux-devtools-integration.md

1) Make sure you got the React Native Debugger installed (httpsgithub.comjhen0409react-native-debugger)

2) Enable JS Debugging in the running app (open development overlay via CTRL + M  CMD + M on Android devices, CMD + D on iOS devices)

3) Install the redux-devtools-extension package via npm install --save-dev redux-devtools-extension (httpswww.npmjs.compackageredux-devtools-extension)

4) Enable Redux debugging in your code

import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import { composeWithDevTools } from 'redux-devtools-extension';
 
const store = createStore(reducer, composeWithDevTools());
Important Make sure you remove this code when building your app for production!

You'll see this approach in action in the Shop App course module (Adding Items to the Cart lecture)!
